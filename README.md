## INTRODUCTION
Simple script to use as a easy to use & configure launcher.

&nbsp;

## DESCRIPTION
This script is designed to be used like a menu launcher, it's efficient because the GUI you use to build your menu is windows explorer.

Simply add .lnk files to add programs, .url files for website shortcuts, and all your favorite folders and files and scripts. Folders can be used to create popup menus, allowing you to create very complex menu hierarchies. 

As an alternative to moving your favorite folders and files, you can create shortcuts/links to the existing locations in whatever directory you choose to have as your menu-launcher folder in.

Default hotkeys to show the menu:

    Xbutton2
    Win+Z
